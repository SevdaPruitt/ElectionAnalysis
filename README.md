# ElectionAnalysis
1. Overview of Election Audit: 
  Initial audit request was on the following data points:
      - Total number of votes cast 
      - A complete list of candidates who received votes
      - Total number of votes each candidate received
      - Percentage of votes each candidate won
      - The winner of the election based on popular vote
      
  After providing the list above, it was necessary to build more on the initial work and deep dive into further 
  
      - The voter turnout for each county
      - The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
      - The county with the highest turnout
      
  Looking at the election data more in details, specifically at county level provides more transparency to election commission.
